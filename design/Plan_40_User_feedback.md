1. Can we get a dialog to allow you to choose the existing project near match instead of only creating the typo (y/n/c) Or else clarify how? Without having to re enter it.

2. `tatl 98 onoff 14:40..15:21` doesn't allow task id in front (unrecognized subcommand '98') This is a surprise, because I didn't think other commands cared about index order.

3. On confirmation, always be clear about the default, e.g. [[y]/n/c]

4. Bug: weird state
