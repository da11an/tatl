### 1. Reorder kanban: live, next, queued <-> paused, proposed

### 2. New view to show allocations besides just task show <id>, and way to call for live id without using the id, or way to get the live task id programmatically.

### 3. Consider adding a color:column option that colorizes rows based on a color, for example to call out priority, or due dates, or allocation, etc.

### 4. Catch non-token text after task list as description search. See what taskwarrior does.

### 5. task projects list to reflect nesting properly, with nested tasks indented and a count of how many tasks are assigned to that (no roll up) broken into columns of status (pending, completed, closed)
